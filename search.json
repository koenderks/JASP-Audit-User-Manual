    "text": "Downloading JASP\nStatistical theory is fundamental to many auditing procedures. To perform these procedures effectively, auditors need user-friendly software for statistical analyses and the knowledge to interpret the results. JASP (JASP Team, 2025) is an open-source, free-of-charge, cross-platform statistical software program that supports statistical auditing through its Audit module (Derks et al., 2021).\nThe Audit module (i.e., JASP for Audit) allows auditors to plan, execute, and interpret a wide range of statistical auditing procedures using state-of-the-art statistical methods, thereby reducing programming errors and simplifying the process. Tailored for auditors, the module features an intuitive interface that aligns with audit processes and international standards on auditing. In addition to standard frequentist methods, the Audit module incorporates Bayesian methods to enhance audit transparency and efficiency by utilizing existing information.\nIn summary, the Audit module takes care of the complex statistical work, allowing you to concentrate on interpreting the results of your analysis. The remaining paragraphs in this chapter discuss how to get started using JASP for Audit.\nJASP for Audit is part of JASP, which can be freely downloaded from www.jasp-stats.org. Click the ‘Download JASP’ button on the homepage to access the download page and choose your preferred installation. JASP is available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Chrome OS.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Stage 1: Planning\nIn the planning stage, you determine the sample size needed to support the assertion that the population’s misstatement is below the performance materiality. This involves using prior audit outcomes and information about inherent risk and control risk. Expectations about error rates also influence the sample size required to maintain statistical confidence.\n\n\n1.1.2 Stage 2: Selection\nUsing the sample size from the planning stage, you select a statistically representative sample. Each sampling unit receives an inclusion probability, and units are selected based on these probabilities. Monetary unit sampling assigns probabilities to individual monetary units, making higher-value items more likely to be selected. Record sampling assigns equal probabilities to all items.\n\n\n1.1.3 Stage 3: Execution\nIn the execution stage, you assess the correctness of selected items. The simplest method categorizes items as correct or incorrect, while a more accurate method considers the true value (audit value) of items. Annotating samples with audit values provides a more precise estimate of misstatement. If book values are unavailable, use the correct/incorrect method.\n\n\n1.1.4 Stage 4: Evaluation\nIn the evaluation stage, you use the annotated sample to infer the total misstatement in the population. Statistical techniques calculate a projected maximum misstatement, and the population is approved if this is below the performance materiality.",

    "text": "1.2 The audit sampling workflow in JASP\nThe Audit module in JASP offers two ways to navigate the audit sampling workflow: the Sampling Workflow analysis, which guides you through all four stages, and individual analyses for Planning, Selection, and Evaluation. This chapter uses the Sampling Workflow analysis to explain the Audit module’s core functionality.\nLet’s explore an example of the audit sampling workflow. To follow along, open the ‘Testing for Overstatements’ dataset from the Data Library. Navigate to the top-left menu, click ‘Open’, then ‘Data Library’, select ‘7. Audit’, and finally click on the text ‘Testing for Overstatements’ (not the green JASP-icon button).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will open a dataset with three columns: ‘ID’, ‘bookValue’, and ‘auditValue’. The ‘ID’ column represents the identification number of the items in the population. The ‘bookValue’ column shows the recorded values of the items, while the ‘auditValue’ column displays the true values. The ‘auditValue’ column is included for illustrative purposes, as auditors typically know the true values only for the audited sample, not for all items in the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Stage 1: Planning\nTo start the sampling workflow, click on the Audit module icon and select ‘Sampling Workflow’. This will open the following interface, where you need to fill in the options for the statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, enter the variable indicating the identification numbers of the items in the corresponding box (indicated with a 1). Optionally, if you have access to the book values of the items, you can enter this variable as well.\nNext, formulate your sampling objectives (indicated with a 2). Enable the ‘Performance materiality’ objective if you want to test whether the total misstatement in the population exceeds a certain limit (i.e., the performance materiality). This approach allows you to plan a sample such that, when the sample meets your expectations, the maximum error is said to be below performance materiality. Enable the ‘Minimum precision’ objective if you want to obtain a required minimum precision when estimating the total misstatement in the population. This approach allows you to plan a sample such that, when the sample meets expectations, the uncertainty of your estimate is within a tolerable percentage. In the example, we choose a performance materiality of 3.5%.\nThen, indicate how many misstatements are tolerable in the sample (indicated with a 3). In the example, we choose to tolerate one full misstatement in the sample.\nAdditionally, indicate the risks of material misstatement via the audit risk model (indicated with a 4). According to the Audit Risk Model, audit risk can be divided into three constituents: inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk. Inherent risk is the risk posed by an error in a financial statement due to a factor other than a failure of internal controls. Control risk is the probability that a material misstatement is not prevented or detected by the internal control systems of the company (e.g., computer-managed databases). Both these risks are commonly assessed by the auditor on a 3-point scale consisting of low, medium, and high. Detection risk is the probability that an auditor will fail to find material misstatements in an organization’s financial statements. For a given level of audit risk, the tolerable level of detection risk bears an inverse relationship to the other two assessed risks. Intuitively, a greater risk of material misstatement should require a lower tolerable detection risk and, accordingly, more persuasive audit evidence. In this example, we choose to set all risks to ‘High’ and solely rely on evidence from substantive testing.\nThe primary output from the planning stage, shown below, indicates that a minimum sample size of 134 items is required to achieve 95% assurance that the misstatement in the population is below 3.5%, while allowing for one misstatement in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, progress to the selection stage by clicking the ‘To Selection’ button (indicated with a 5). For a more detailed explanation of the options and output in the planning stage, see Chapter 2.\n\n\n1.2.2 Stage 2: Selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, progress to the execution stage by clicking the ‘To Execution’ button (indicated with a 4).\n\n\n1.2.3 Stage 3: Execution\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, progress to the evaluation stage by clicking the ‘To Evaluation’ button (indicated with a 4). For a more detailed explanation of the options and output in the evaluation stage, see Chapter 4.\n\n\n1.2.4 Stage 4: Evaluation",
