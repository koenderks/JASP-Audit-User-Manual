    "text": "Downloading JASP\nStatistical theory is fundamental to many auditing guidelines and procedures. Auditors need user-friendly software for statistical analyses and the knowledge to interpret these results. JASP is an open-source, free, cross-platform statistical software that supports statistical auditing through its Audit module.\nThe Audit module allows auditors to plan, perform, and interpret most statistical auditing procedures using correct methods, minimizing programming errors. Designed with auditors in mind, it features a user-friendly interface aligned with audit processes and International Standards on Auditing. Besides standard frequentist methods, the module includes Bayesian methods to enhance audit transparency and efficiency by incorporating existing information. In summary, the Audit module handles the statistical heavy lifting, enabling you to plan, evaluate, and interpret your analyses using both classical and Bayesian techniques.\nThe Audit module is a part of JASP, which can be freely downloaded from www.jasp-stats.org. Click the ‘Download JASP’ button on the homepage to access the download page and choose your preferred installation. JASP is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. Installation follows standard procedures.",

The following sections cover its accessibility features, including help files and result validation using the R package jfa.\n\nHelp files\nAfter opening an analysis in the Audit module, click the blue ‘i’ icon next to the analysis title to access a help file describing its functionality. For some options, like sampling units and algorithms, additional help files are available, indicated by a blue ‘i’ icon next to the option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation of statistical results\nThe Audit module’s statistical results are derived from the R package jfa (Derks, 2025).

This can be challenging, but the Audit module simplifies the process into four stages: planning, selection, execution, and evaluation.\nMore detailed information about the individual stages in the audit sampling workflow is provided below.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1.1 Stage 1: Planning\nIn the planning stage, you determine the sample size needed to support the assertion that the population’s misstatement is below the performance materiality. This involves using prior audit outcomes and information about inherent risk and control risk. Expectations about error rates also influence the sample size required to maintain statistical confidence.\n\n\n1.1.2 Stage 2: Selection\nUsing the sample size from the planning stage, you select a statistically representative sample. Each sampling unit receives an inclusion probability, and units are selected based on these probabilities. Monetary unit sampling assigns probabilities to individual monetary units, making higher-value items more likely to be selected. Record sampling assigns equal probabilities to all items.\n\n\n1.1.3 Stage 3: Execution\nIn the execution stage, you assess the correctness of selected items. The simplest method categorizes items as correct or incorrect, while a more accurate method considers the true value (audit value) of items. Annotating samples with audit values provides a more precise estimate of misstatement. If book values are unavailable, use the correct/incorrect method.\n\n\n1.1.4 Stage 4: Evaluation\nIn the evaluation stage, you use the annotated sample to infer the total misstatement in the population. Statistical techniques calculate a projected maximum misstatement, and the population is approved if this is below the performance materiality.",

This chapter uses the Sampling Workflow analysis to explain the Audit module’s core functionality.\nFind the Sampling Workflow analysis in JASP by clicking the Audit module icon and selecting Sampling Workflow. The interface is interactive, reflecting JASP’s and JfA’s philosophies, with advanced options hidden under the Advanced Options section. Information is progressively disclosed as you move through the workflow.\nIn the interactive layouts, select the corresponding data and options to plan your audit. Upon completing a stage, request a report by clicking Download Report. Each stage produces output in tables and plots to clarify statistical results.\n\n1.2.1 Example",
